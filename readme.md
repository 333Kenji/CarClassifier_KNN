# Motivations

As part of a series of basic projects, I'm using this project to build intuition in the process of applying the KNN algorithm as a classifier.

## Real World Problem
It'd be great to be able to look at a large number of vehicles and find a particular class based on its features.

## ML Problem
The problem will be to build a model capable of discerning the highest quality vehicles from the test set.

### Solution
- After examing and preparing the data I will build a pipeline that'll encode the independent feature values into ordinal categorical features. I'll then use this pipeline for hyperperameter tuning, training, and testing/evaluating the optimal KNN model.

### Target
The target for this project will the highest class of car in the dataset, classed as the 'vhigh' value.

### Goals: Project Objectives
- A classification model that has an optimal number of k and an accuracy of at least 95%

### Evaluation Metrics:
* Accuracy: .97
* Precision: 1
* Recall: .41
* F1 Scores: .58

Also,
    - elbow method

### Optimal Hyperperamters:
k = 5

## Methodologies
- Feature Analysis and comparison with Pandas, Numpy, and matplotlib/Seaborn.
- Encoding string-type ordinal categorial variable values as numeric values using the scikit-learn encoding module.
- Hyperperameter Tuning and Model Selection using the scikit-learn implementation of KNN Classifier algorithm within a pipeline built using the scikit-learn pipeline module.
- Training and Testing/Evalutaing model using the scikit-learn metrics modeul and a custom score/confusion matrix vsualization

## Libraries and Technologies
- Python
- Numpy, Pandas
- Scikit-learn
  * 
- Jupyter, VSCde

- [ ] Add "components" document to easily copy & paste sections of the readme
- [ ] Multi-language Support
    - [ ] Chinese
    - [ ] Spanish



    - Choosing the 'class' feature as my target this becomes a multilabel classification probem because that feature has four possible ordinal values: 'unacc' (unacceptable), 'acc' (acceptable), 'good', and 'vgood' (very good).
    By using the KNN algorithm I'm able to leverage it's grouping ability to classify across more than to labels as would be the cade with a simple application of logistic regression.
- Data Visualization
    - Using Seaborn for my primary analysis and I also use Pandas to view the data as it moves through each preprocessing and transformation phase wih evaluaion (elbow) produced via a simple matplotlib plot.
- Predictive Modeling
- etc.
