## Motivations

As part of a series of basic projects, I'm using this project to build intuition in the process of applying the KNN algorithm as a classifier.

My target for this project will be the datasets 'class' feature which denotes vehicle quality. The problem then will be to build a classifier that can discern a car's quality by looking at its features.
The Solution
- Since the dataset is quite clean, I will simply have to encode and scale the data before applying the algorithm which will then discern the typical features belonging to each class.
- Evaluation Metrics.
    - Using the elbow method.
    
Goals: Project Objectives
- A classification model that has an optimal number of k and an accuracy of at least 95%

## Methodologies
### Methods Employed
- Feature Analisys
- Machine Learning
    - Choosing the 'class' feature as my target this becomes a multilabel classification probem because that feature has four possible ordinal values: 'unacc' (unacceptable), 'acc' (acceptable), 'good', and 'vgood' (very good).
    By using the KNN algorithm I'm able to leverage it's grouping ability to classify across more than to labels as would be the cade with a simple application of logistic regression.
- Data Visualization
    - Using Seaborn for my primary analysis and I also use Pandas to view the data as it moves through each preprocessing and transformation phase wih evaluaion (elbow) produced via a simple matplotlib plot.
- Predictive Modeling
- etc.
## Libraries and Technologies
- Python
- Numpy, Pandas
- Scikit-learn
- Jupyter, VSCde
